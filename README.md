## How to computed the topological backbone of the cytoskeleton

In this notebook we illustrate how the algorithm presented in this work is able to extract the toplogy of actin filaments from electron tomography data. For the purose of visulization we created an artificial 2D test image. The extension to 3D is straight forward.
